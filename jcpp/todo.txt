group1:
-------
-implement all JSystem class
-make thread excecption handling more robust
-review call of all keySet/entrySet/iterator and check that we call delete
-implement all jcpp.util, jcpp.io, jcpp.net (a quite big list :))
-remove implementation allowing == to call equals ?
-implement socket/read/connecttimeout
-keep operator+= -= *= ?
-wiki pages on how to generate classes, interfaces, proxy
-wiki page to explain how to setup qt ide + compile project
-what is the equivalence to load dynamically jars?

group2:
-------
-tree of classloader
-check all new/delete calls
-check call to delete[]
-constructor in order to ease casting

group3: TODO have test cases for input stream
-------
-primitive arrays of primitive type
-primitive arrays of object
-primitive array of primitive array
-object of object of object
-object containing proxy
-in rmi : test proxy in parameter+ in return+ in somewhere deep in an object
-test case for enum with io and rpc

-add more attributes to JField like static, transient, ...
-generate proxy classes for interfaces => use java parser module for that
-use template in PrimitiveArray ?
