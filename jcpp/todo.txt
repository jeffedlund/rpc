group1:
-------
-work on equals/hashCode/clone of JObject
-work on wiki documentation
-use which cast? () or dynamic or static?
-what to do with map/keys as pointers
-what to do for Comparable and ordering. Look at JObjectStreamField
-use template in PrimitiveArray
-implement socket/read/connecttimeout
-create adapters socket, serversocket
-test case for enum with io and rpc
-clone layer
-implement all JSystem class
-in rmi : test proxy in parameter, return, in somewhere deep in an object
-issue with duplicate methods in object and its interface. what to do?
-implement all jcpp.util, jcpp.io, jcpp.net (a quite big list :))

group2:
-------
-tree of classloader
-check all new/delete calls, check delete[] for arrays
-test with java 1.8
-constructor in order to ease casting

group3: TODO have test cases for input stream
-------
-primitive arrays of primitive type
-primitive arrays of object
-primitive array of primitive array
-object of object of object
-object containing proxy

-add more attributes to JField like static, transient, ...
-generate proxy classes for interfaces => use java parser module for that
