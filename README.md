RPC
===

It is always hard to describe what something does in very short words.
Let's list what it does or what it will do :
  1. API similar to Java (very very similar :))
  2. Object un/marshalling. As it is similar to Java, it will be cross language too :)
  3. RMI like feature (it is not done yet but next steps :) )

Ideas:
  1. Define which license (contact if interested)
  2. More tests, more documentation, more samples,...
