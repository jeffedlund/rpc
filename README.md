JCPP
====

It is always hard to describe what something does in very short words.
Let's list what it does or what it will do :
  1. C++ API similar to Java (very very similar :))
  2. Object un/marshalling. As it is similar to Java, we will be able to un/marshal C++ objects to/from Java objects 
  3. RMI like feature

Ideas:
  1. Decide which license (contact if interested)
  2. More tests, more documentation, more samples,...
